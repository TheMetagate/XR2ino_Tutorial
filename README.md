# XR2ino

Metagate is an Italian startup developing Mixed Reality experiences for the Meta Quest. Our team creates customized applications for clients and original experiences released directly by the company. In this case, we wanted to experiment with using sensors and Arduino to make Mixed Reality even more engaging by connecting it to the physical world, embracing the potential of Extended Reality.

This code is designed to connect an Arduino BLE device to the XR2ino app, developed in Unity, for seamless integration with Mixed Reality experiences on Meta Quest headsets.
